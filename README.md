# Tivix Tech Challenge
The task given was to create a three page website using Jamstack principles and a list of given technologies. Of those, I decided to use Gatsby as my framework, Prismic for the CMS, and Netlify for hosting (and form submissions).

## Conclusion
Overall, this task took me about four hours to complete. I spent most of my focus on the function rather than design so that was left fairly minimal. Thank you for giving the time to evaluate my work and assess my candidacy overall.
